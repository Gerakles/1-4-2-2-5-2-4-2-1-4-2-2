# SMPP Protocol
   ## defines:
        Using the SMPP Protocol, an SMS application system called the 'External Short Message Entityâ€™ (ESME) may initiate an application layer connection with an SMSC over a TCP/IP or X.25 network connection and may then send short messages and receive short messages to and from the SMSC respectively. The ESME may also query, cancel or replace short messages using SMPP.
